# Introduction

A civil war is typically caused by a combination of complex factors and its effects are usually long-lasting. But does it only impact its country of origin? How do the dynamics of economic and societal metric evolve surrounding these onset? Does a state equips itself in suspicion of civil conflict? (??ADD MORE??) ? These are the questions we are going to answer here.

In their publication, Muchlinski, Siroky, et al. performed prediction of the onset of civil wars using two different techniques : logarithmic regressions and Random Forests. While the logistic regression are widely used to developed model with binary outcomes, the use of Random Forests was original and allowed the researchers to identify features with a strong predictive power.
These metrics were for the most already considered relevant in the literature (GDP growth, Education level etc.) as explanatory variables. This data story presents itself as an extension of this paper.
