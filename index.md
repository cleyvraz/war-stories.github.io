# Introduction


A civil war (CW) is typically caused by a combination of complex factors and its effects are usually long-lasting. But does it only impact its country of origin? How do the dynamics of economical and societal metric evolve surrounding these onset? Does a state equips itself in suspicion of civil conflict? (??ADD MORE??) ? These are the questions we are going to answer here.

In their publication, Muchlinski, Siroky, et al. seeked to predict the onset of a civil war using two different techniques : logarithmic regressions and Random Forests. While the logistic regression are widely used to developed model with binary outcomes, the use of Random Forests was original and allowed the researchers to identify features with a strong predictive power.
These metrics were for the most already considered relevant in the literature (GDP growth, Education level etc.) as explanatory variables. This data story presents itself as an extension of this paper and aims at understanding and visualizing trends in these pertinent features.

But first, what is a civil war? The dataset used is from Sambanis which defines civil war as an armed conflict, in which the governement is one of the combatant, in a state recognized internationnaly with a population of at least half a million. The onset is declared as the year in which there are at least 500 deaths as long as there are 1000 deaths over the next three years.

Let us have a quick look at the dataset. In the map below, you can see the 116 CW onset
